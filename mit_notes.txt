# Basic stuff to inclide in the AI:
	1. take winning move
	2. take an opponents winning move
	3. Take center square over edges and corners
	4. Take corners of edges
	5. Take edges if they are all that's available
* take middle bottom first
@def threat - a threat is a square that if taken results in a win
@def useless threat - a threat that will never be caarried out
@def odd/evenness - determined by row number

* First player normally gets odd threats, second player normally gets even
* White is player one, black is player 2
! white odd, black even, white wins
! white and black both evens: no column where an odd number of squares can be played, both players get their normal squares, black can eliminate white threat and win
! white has even threat black has odd threat: draw
! white and black both have odd threats: usually both don't work 

* important to make sure taking care of one threat doesn't create another one
